A Temporal-Spectral Generative Adversarial Network based End-to-end Packet Loss Concealment for Wideband Speech Transmission

This project is the implementation of "A Temporal-Spectral Generative Adversarial Network based End-to-end Packet Loss Concealment for Wideband Speech Transmission", which is submitted to Journal of the Acoustical Society of America. We also provide some experimental results of the test in the Voice Bank corpus. (Loss rate ranging from 5% to 30%)
